# Deep Graph Persistence
This is the code for our work "Addressing caveats of neural persistence with deep graph persistence".

## Overview
This repository contains code for replicating our empirical experiments regarding neural persistence (NP) in trained neural networks.
Also, this repository contains code for replicating our experiments on using deep graph persistence for detecting image corruptions.

For calculating NP, we rely on the [great code](https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/Neural-Persistence) from the original [Neural Persistence: A Complexity Measure for Deep Neural Networks Using Algebraic Topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09764) paper.

## Setup
Besides standard dependencies available via `pip`, this repository also requires `Aleph`.
Detailed instructions on how to install `Aleph` can be found in the [corresponding repository](https://github.com/Pseudomanifold/Aleph).

After installing `Aleph`, the remaining dependencies can be installed from `requirements.txt` via TODO.

## Replication
TODO.

## References
